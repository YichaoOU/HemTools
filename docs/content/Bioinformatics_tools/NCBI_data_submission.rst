NCBI data submission
============


You will need a NCBI account for data submission.

If you have processed data and raw data to submit, please submit it to GEO.

If you only have raw data to submit, please submit it to SRA.

You can download the template here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/examples/seq_template_v2.1.xls

Ref: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html


For GEO data, you need ``MD5 Checksums`` (data integrity) for all files. For this, you can put all files in one dir and run ``md5sum *``
