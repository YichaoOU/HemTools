Facts about CRISPR-Cas9
====================



What is bulge?
^^^^^^^^^^

Here we show that genomic sites could be cleaved by CRISPR/Cas9 systems when DNA sequences contain insertions (‘DNA bulge’) or deletions (‘RNA bulge’) compared to the RNA guide strand, and Cas9 nickases used for paired nicking can also tolerate bulges in one of the guide strands.
