Notes on ATAC-seq, open chromatin, and footprints/motif
========================




low chip-seq peak overlap with ATAC-seq peak
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In one of the projects I'm doing, one TF only has 55% overlap with ATAC-seq peak, while another TF in the same cell line overlaped 93%. 

I was suprised by this and checked TF-chip-seq data in Hudep2, for BCL11A, GATA1, KLF1 and TAL1. They all above 90%. CTCF is a little lower, 83%. LRF (from GEO), 33%, our LRF (51%). LRF tends to have >100k peaks, same thing in public data and our data.
