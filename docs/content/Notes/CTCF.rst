Current observations/claims for CTCF in insulation potency and chromatin interaction
================================================



- Chromatin interactions are possibly formed by convergent CTCF pairs, although there are tandom CTCF pairs. But the chances of a loop with convergent pair is 3 times higher than a tandem pair.

- In terms of insulation potency, the number of CTCF sites is important, more sites means more insulation power. But these observation is tested using core TAD boundary CTCF sequences.

- Replacing TAD boundary CTCF sequences with non-TAD boundary CTCF sequences significantly reduced insulation power. And it seems the +/- 20bp flanking sequences of the 19bp CTCF motif is the key. One known motif is the CTCF-upstream motif, which binds to a Znic-Finger protein.

- Disruption of the CTCF-upstream motif did not affect CTCF binding.
