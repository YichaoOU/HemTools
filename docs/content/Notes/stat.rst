These statistics aim to provide a reference for your cutoffs.

 95th percentile distance from all positive cCRE-gene pairs


These distance cutoffs ranged from 120 kb (RNAPII ChIA-PET in HeLa) to 1.83 Mb (Hi-C in K562).

the median genomic distances of the positive pairs are 46,934 bp in K562 and 37,556 bp in MCF-7

and ~91% of loop anchors were associated with
either a promoter or an enhancer29, as expected, with a median distance of 130 kb

```
However, the distance between
a target gene and its regulatory elements can be as far as 2 or
3 Mb (Krivega and Dean 2012)

For the MCF7
and Hippo data, the average distances between a target gene
and its farthest enhancer were 246 and 99 kb, respectively

The median distance
between loop anchor midpoints was 255 kb, and nearly 10%
were over 1 Mb in size (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This established a
map of chromatin loops in human pancreatic islets
