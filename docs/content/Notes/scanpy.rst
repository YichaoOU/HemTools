Using Scanpy to replace pandas 
========================



Summary
^^^^^^^

The ``AnnData`` object is more powerful than pandas. Moreover, scanpy provides some automatically operations and visualizations easier for EDA.


Usage
^^^^^


AnnData is usually stored as ``h5ad`` file, which is quite different than csv or txt files I used daily.
