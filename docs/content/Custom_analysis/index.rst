Get Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This folder provides pipelines for some custom analyses derived from projects or people's requests.

The general usage is to use ``run_lsf.py``

.. code:: bash

	run_lsf.py -f input.tsv -p NAME_OF_THE_PIPELINE


Input
^^^^^

As usual, input is a tsv file, each different analyses may require different number of columns
