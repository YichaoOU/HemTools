Promoter interaction data
==================





hg19
----


Significant interactions were downloaded from two resources

1. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0494-8

Supp file 3 (PO interaction) and 4 (PP interaction)

2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863249

"Detected interactions.zip" from the paper link, using "PCHiC_peak_matrix_cutoff5.txt"

There are 484 baits with NA gene name. NA is filled with nearest gene name.

*Process*


Data were processed to output to the following format:

chr, start, end, gene name, score


PP interactions will be double-counted in this format.
