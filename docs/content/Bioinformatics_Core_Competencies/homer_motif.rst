homer motif result interpretation
===============================


Key metrics to consider are: 

- p-value
- %target
- %background

Things I forgot to talk about in the video:

Note that motif length will affect all three metrics. Longer motif tends to be harder to find (so smaller %background), so their p-value can be very significant even with smaller %target. Shorter motifs tend to be eaiser o find, but not necessarily less significant p-value than longer one, because %target have more impact on p-value. Generally, 10%-20% of target sequence is already a good motif. With cleaner input, this %target can be further increased, e.g., through IDR peaks.
