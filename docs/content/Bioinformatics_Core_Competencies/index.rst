Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's always a question about where to start for many people who wants to learn bioinformatics systematically. I think the answer is to make clear about the learning objectives. Bioinformatics people can be generally classified into three categories: Bioinformatics users, Bioinformatics scientists, and Bioinformatics engineers. Here at stjude, most people who want to learn Bioinformatics are actually Bioinformatics users. So our goal is to let them know the following:

- Common Bioinformatics programming languages

- Common Bioinformatics data formats

- Common Bioinformatics data analyses

- Common Bioinformatics tools

- Common Bioinformatics data visualizations


Approach
^^^^^^^^

We are not aiming to provide a systematically Bioinformatics learning course. Rather, we organize our class by topics and for each topic, we provide a self-contained notebook.


Reference
^^^^^^^^

My Ph.D advisor, Dr. Lonnie Welch, contributed significantly to Bioinformatics education, especially on setting up the framework for Bioinformatics Core Competencies. One of the paper I like the most is: [Bioinformatics Curriculum Guidelines: Toward a Definition of Core Competencies](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003496).
